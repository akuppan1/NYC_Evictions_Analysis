# NYC_Evictions_Analysis

I was going through NYC’s OpenData and stumbled upon the evictions database.
<br>The dataset I used is: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Evictions/6z8x-wfk4
<br>The questions I wanted answered were:
1) How many evictions occurred in each borough each year?
2) How many evictions happened per year?
3) How had COVID-19 affected evictions in NYC?
4) Why did evictions occur even with a moratorium?
Without further ado, here is what I found:

Even with a moratorium, evictions still occurred in 2021.

We see there is a significant dip during COVID-19, however there is still eviction activity.

The number of evictions hovered around 20,000 and then we see the effects of the COVID-19 moratorium.

These are the top 10 zip codes and their eviction numbers for the years 2017–2019

To answer my last question on why these evictions occurred in 2021. They may be due to special non-rent related circumstances. There are court cases related to each of those evictions. Another interesting note is the top 10 zip codes with the highest evictions changed dramatically after the moratorium.
